$data[[1]]$fields$description
[1] "On 20 November around 5.30 UTC (16.30 local time) the Ulawun volcano, located in the northern New Britain Island in eastern Papua New Guinea, approximately 125 km south-west of Rabaul Town, started to erupt. The explosive eruption produced a plume that reached up to 18 km above sea level dispersing ash to the west. A significant pyroclastic flow occurred during the activity. Media report, as of 21 November, a number of preventively evacuated people across the area nearby the volcano and some canceled flights from the Hoskins Town airport. On 20 November the aviation colour code has been raised to red from the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) and as of 21 November at 7.00 UTC it remains still in force. ([ECHO, 21 Nov 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4016555))\n\nThe volcano eruption caused mass displacement across the affected areas. IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) site assessment tool was rolled out in West New Britain (WNB) and East New Britain (ENB) within a week following the eruption and identified 8,565 persons (1,707 Households [HH]) displaced from the local villages in West New Britain (WNB) and East New Britain (ENB).
